# 📄 Szkoleo: Business & Product Overview

### 1. Business Summary
**Szkoleo** is an interactive e-learning web application currently in the MVP stage. Built on the core belief that "knowledge should be for everyone," it provides high-quality, highly interactive educational content at an affordable price point. The platform generates revenue through direct sales of first-party courses and by taking a percentage commission on courses sold by third-party creators.

### 2. Product Description
Szkoleo goes beyond traditional video-only learning platforms by offering a multi-format educational experience. Course creators can build comprehensive curriculums using:
*   Video lessons
*   Text-based lessons
*   Interactive quizzes
*   Built-in programming tasks
These features make learning highly active, distinguishing the platform from passive consumption models.

### 3. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** Students and individuals looking to learn programming, computer science, and related tech skills affordably without sacrificing top-tier quality.
*   **Secondary:** Course creators seeking better, more interactive tools to teach and engage their students.

### 4. Market & Competitors
*   **Main Competitor:** Udemy.
*   **Differentiator:** Where Udemy restricts creators primarily to video uploads, Szkoleo provides built-in interactive tools (coding environments, quizzes, text), offering a much richer and more effective learning environment for technical subjects.

### 5. Marketing Strategy

*   **Acquisition Channels:** Social media and paid ads.
